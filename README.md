## The Mission
Before we can start java development we need to install a Java development kit.
#### What is Java development kit or in short JDK ?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications. You need the JDK to convert your source code into a format that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) can execute.

The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and some other development tools. The Java Runtime Environment itself consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), supporting files, and core classes.
