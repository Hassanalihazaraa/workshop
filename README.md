## The Mission
Before we can start java development we need to install a Java development kit before that here is short explanation over JDK.
#### What is Java development kit or in short JDK ?
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment that offers a collection of tools and libraries necessary for developing Java applications. You need the JDK to convert your source code into a format that the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) can execute.

The JDK includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc), and some other development tools. The Java Runtime Environment itself consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), supporting files, and core classes.

Typically, if you are only interested in running Java programs on your machine or browser, you only need to install JRE. However, if you would like to develop an application and do Java programming, you will need JDK.

**But since April 16, 2019, you have to create an account in order to be able to download JDK**
